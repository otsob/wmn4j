	 * Returns the results of running pattern discovery with SIATECHF algorithm.
	 * <p>
	 * SIATECHF works by constructing a point set representation of the given score and
	 * finding maximal translatable patterns and their translational equivalence classes.
	 * Only those equivalence classes are returned whose compression ratio exceeds the given value.
	 * <p>
	 * Compression ratio is the number of notes covered by the occurrences of the pattern divided the number of points
	 * required to represent all the pattern occurrences. Patterns whose occurrences have little overlap, consists
	 * of multiple notes and occur frequently have high compression ratio values. It is recommended to avoid
	 * values less than 2.0 for compression ratio as otherwise a large number of uninteresting repeated patterns
	 * will be returned. Using compression ratio 0.0 will return all translational equivalence classes in
	 * the point set representation and values smaller than 0.0 are not defined.
	 *
	 * @param score            the score for which repeated pattern discovery is performed
	 * @param compressionRatio the required non-negative minimum compression ratio for the returned patterns
	 * @return the results of running pattern discovery with SIATECH algorithm
