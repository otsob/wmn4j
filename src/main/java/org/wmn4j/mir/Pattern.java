/**
 * Interface for musical patterns. The patterns can represent motifs, melodies,
 * or segments of polyphonic music. A pattern is a sequence of notes, chords,
 * and rests. A pattern can be monophonic or polyphonic. In a monophonic pattern
 * there are no simultaneously occurring notes or chords. In a polyphonic
 * pattern there can be multiple notes occurring at the same time in chords or
 * in multiple voices.
 * <p>
 * The notation elements in monophonic pattern are iterated in temporal orders.
 * For polyphonic patterns the elements are iterated first by iterating through the
 * voice with the smallest number and then moving on the voice with the next greatest
 * number and so on.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are required to be thread-safe.
