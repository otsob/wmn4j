wmn4j is a Java library for handling western music notation. The main purpose of wmn4j is to enable easy and efficient
analysis of scores and wmn4j is intended to also provide functionality for algorithmic composition by generating scores.

## The structure of wmn4j

The structure of scores in wmn4j is described in a separate [document](./doc/structure.md).
The [API Documentation](https://otsob.github.io/wmn4j) provides the Javadoc for the latest release of wmn4j. There are a
few architectural design principles in wmn4j:

* All notation classes are immutable
* Builder classes are used for creating objects
* Scores can be read using different types of iterators

See the [examples](./doc/examples) directory for simple examples of how to use wmn4j.

### Building wmn4j

wmn4j is developed and built with OpenJDK 17. wmn4j uses Gradle and can be built by running Gradle build. With the
current configuration the build consists of compilation, unit tests, and static analysis. It is recommended to delegate
the building of the project to Gradle using the provided Gradle wrapper in the IDE to ensure all dependencies etc. are
handled correctly. To build locally, run

```
./gradlew build
```
